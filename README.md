# Reflection Questions

### How did using Figma designs as references affect your coding process?
The Figma designs helped me visualize how to set up my code. Actually seeing how elements looked while active helped me execute the design.

Challenges I encountered consisted of making sure my divs and containers were aligned correctly and making sure everything was accessibility compliant. 

### How can the feedback and community resources on Frontend Mentor help you improve as a developer?
Feedback and community resources can help when you are stuck on a problem during a challenge. You could reach out to someone in the community and see if they are also having problems.You can also see how others are executing their code and maybe you will find a more efficient solution and figure out how to implement it for yourself or refactor your code.
