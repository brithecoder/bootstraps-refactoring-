# Reflection Questions

### What challenges did you face when refactoring your code to use Bootstrap?
A challenge that I faced while refactoring my code is learning how to use the inline styling that were specific to Bootstrap. I mostly googled how to do a certain thing while in Bootstraps.

### How did using Bootstrap utility classes and components simplify your styling process?
It simplified my work by allowing me to plug in the project specific information to pre made components where I didnâ€™t have to worry about making the component responsive and any extra details I need to make costume I was able to execute using inline styling.

### In what scenarios might you choose not to use Bootstrap and write custom CSS instead?
You might have to write custom css while using pseudo-class functionality like on hover or on click.
